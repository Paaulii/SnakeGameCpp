###### Setup
1. Make sure that compiler is set to x86 architecture
2. Run compiler in debug and release mode (ignore errors)
3. To Debug folder add all files ending with "-d" from SFML-2.5.1/_bin folder
4. To Release folder add all files without "-d" from SFML-2.5.1/_bin folder

###### Workflow
1. Documentation in polish
2. Comment every created function, so we know what it does
